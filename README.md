## 📇 Concept 📇
During the projectweek we are given a choice between 2 projects, we have decided to go with the project Prompts engineering with poems. For this assignment we will have to fetch an api where you can generate poems based on themes and types. The user has a few types to choose from and fir the theme they can write anything they want.

## 📖 Job story 📖
When I am in a museum I would like to be able to generate poems based on themes.

## 👩🏼 User test 👩🏼
We conducted a user test on 3 users. We asked if they could just scroll and navigate through our application. During the user test we discover various things like, the user can’t use the keyboard. 

We noted all the obstacle the user had while using our application. Per user we have described what they went through

--- 

### User 1: 
Remove on the home page the home button, because he thought that he wasn’t on the home page. 
On the screen you can’t type in the text in the input fields, no keyboard
The touchscreen is basically just a mouse
Keep in mind the touch screen

### User 2: 
Everything went smoothly
He knew where to navigate and what to click 


### User 3:
The UI of the application has to change a bit, it is not that easy to navigate
Give the user feedback, so that they know they are right on track, the user she was really confused on where exactly to go
She was second doubting everything, she was really confused on the page where she had to generate the poems. 


In the future if we want to continue with the application, we will keep these notes in mind and try to implement it to our code.
